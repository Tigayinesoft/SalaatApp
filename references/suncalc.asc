		APPARENT POSITION OF THE SUN IN THE SKY
	[Dave Rusin, math.niu.edu. Last modified  2/24/95]

History: Got tired of seeing this circle of questions raise in sci.math,
rec.gardens, and misc.consumers.house (!) in 1993. Of course, all this
material is already known, but I don't know by whom so I have no references.

This paper describes the calculation of the apparent sun position in
local coordinates for an earth observer.  The first section sets up
notation; section 2 sets up a solution; section 3 is to remove the
effect of one variable and simplify the solution. Section 4 provides
qualitative descriptions of solar motion. In section 5, I address the
conversion of these variables to local time, in section 6 the length
of a day, and in section 7 the amount of sunlight falling (i.e. energy
gain). There is a short discussion of errors in section 8.  An
accompanying BASIC program 'suncalc.ub' carries out these
calculations, although I have not altered older routines which are not
consistent in form with this essay. (As far as I know, though, the
conclusions are correct.)

We assume the earth is a sphere; one may choose units so the radius is 1.
We also assume the earth orbits the sun in a circle (this approximation
is less good, as the earth-sun distance varies about 3% over the year).
We let  L  be the distance from earth to sun (roughly 25000 earth radii).
We will assume the observer is not at the north or south poles (so the
the direction "north" will make sense).

=========== 1. Expressing true sun position========================

We note that in our problem it is equivalent to assume the sun travels
in a circular orbit around the earth, and so we set up spherical coordinates,
using the (north) axis of the earth's rotation as the (positive) z-axis.
We take the x-axis to be the intersection of the earth's equatorial plane
and the plane of the sun's transit. (These planes meet at an angle \alpha
of about 23 degrees, familiar from all desk globes.)

A person on the earth's surface at a latitude of \theta will always
have this fixed spherical coordinate \theta. However, the other spherical
coordinate \phi will run through the interval [0, 2\pi] once per sidereal
day (the sidereal day is the time it takes a given star to return to a
given position in the sky; due to the earth's revolution about the sun,
this is not quite the same as the time between successive noons).

Using standard formulas for spherical coordinates, we then see that
the cartesian coordinates for the observer's position P are

	x = cos(\theta) cos(\phi)
	y = cos(\theta) sin(\phi)
	z = sin(\theta)

where \theta is the fixed latitude and \phi changes linearly in time.

The position of the sun is always in the plane defined by  z = y . tan(\alpha)
and always a fixed distance from the earth (x^2+y^2+z^2=L^2); we deduce
that there is an angle \psi such that the sun's position is

	x = L cos(\psi)
	y = L sin(\psi) cos(\alpha)
	z = L sin(\psi) sin(\alpha)

Since we are assuming a circular orbit, it is true that \psi will change
linearly in time, ranging from 0 to 2\pi in 1 year; the day when
\psi is zero is the day the earth's axis is perpendicular to the line to
the sun, i.e. the March equinox.

=========== 2. Determining apparent sun position===================

Now let us relate these cartesian coordinates to the local coordinates
used by an observer. To a (small) observer on the surface of the earth,
the earth looks flat; that is, the observer does not distinguish (his portion
of) earth from the tangent plane at his location. Positions on the tangent
plane are usually measured against two axes labelled "east" and "north".

"East" is the direction the observer is travelling as the earth rotates,
that is, it is in the direction of the partial derivative
	\partial P / \partial t;
since we know \theta is constant and \phi changes linearly, this is the
same direction as
	\partial P / \partial \phi
Take derivatives to see this is cos(\theta) times
	( -sin(\phi), cos(\phi), 0 )
(we divide by that factor cos(\theta) to get a unit vector).

"North" is the direction travelled when increasing latitude, that is,
the direction of the partial derivative
	\partial P / \partial \theta = 
	(cos(\theta)cos(\phpi), cos(\theta)sin(\phi), sin(\theta))

Finally, the observer uses a direction "Up", which is the same as the
vector from the earth's center to his position, and so is the same
as the vector  P :
	( cos(\theta) cos(\phi), cos(\theta) sin(\phi), sin(\theta) )

These three vectors are orthonormal, and so any other direction can
be expressed as linear combinations of them, using the formula
	v = (v*"North")."North" + (v*"East")."East" + (v*"Up")."Up"
(where "*" is the inner product or dot product.)
In particular, we can do this for the vector joining the earth's center to
the sun (since L is so large, this is essentially the vector from the 
observer to the sun). Since we are interested only in the sun's apparent
position, the length of this vector is irrelevant; dividing by  L
gives us a unit vector, whose coordinates in the "North"-"East"-"Up"
coordinate system are the dot products as above:

N= -             sin(\theta) cos(\psi) cos(\phi)
   - cos(\alpha) sin(\theta) sin(\psi) sin(\phi)
   + sin(\alpha) cos(\theta) sin(\psi)

E= -                         cos(\psi) sin(\phi)
   + cos(\alpha)             sin(\psi) cos(\phi)   [E is theta-independent!]

U= +             cos(\theta) cos(\psi) cos(\phi)
   + cos(\alpha) cos(\theta) sin(\psi) sin(\phi)
   + sin(\alpha) sin(\theta) sin(\psi)

(Remember, \alpha is a global constant; \theta is fixed by the observer's
latitude; \psi changes across a year; \phi changes across a day).

============= 3. Using time to determine \phi==================

In order to use these formulas, one needs to know the current value of
\phi. Roughly this means "what time of day is it", but \phi=0 does not
correspond to any fixed time of day. Instead, we *define* NOON (and midnight) 
to be moments when  E=0  (i.e. when the sun is in the "north"-"up" plane).
We usually describe this by saying the sun is due south (or north). 

This is not quite the same as saying the sun is at its maximal height in 
the sky: that would require  d U / d t = 0, i.e.
	(d U / d \psi) (d \psi / d t ) + (d U / d \phi) (d \phi / d t ) = 0.
As it happens, d U / d \phi = cos(\theta). E, so at the time we called NOON,
the second term drops out. The first term is not zero, but is small since
(d \psi / d t)  is only 1/365 as big as  (d \phi/ d t ). So it is not too
bad of an estimate to think of NOON as being the moment the sun is highest.

We observe that using  E=0  as our definition of NOON  gives the
condition on \phi necessary to declare NOON: 
	tan(\phi) = tan(\psi).cos(\alpha)..........................(*)
(and when \psi is +-\pi/2, \phi is also +-\pi/2.)

If we let  \phi0  be the value of \phi which satisfies this condition,
then we can write any other \phi in the form  \phi = \phi0+\phi1
for some value  \phi1; \phi1 measures the change in the position of
the observer since NOON. Using the angle-addition formulas, the defining
relation  sin(\phi0) = tan(\psi).cos(\alpha).cos(\phi0), and massive
trigonometric cancellations, we obtain simplified expressions for the
apparent location of the sun. Again using  (N,E,U) coordinates, its
position is

N= -             sin(\theta) cos(\psi) sec(\phi0) cos(\phi1)
   + sin(\alpha) cos(\theta) sin(\psi)

E= -                         cos(\psi) sec(\phi0) sin(\phi1)

U= +             cos(\theta) cos(\psi) sec(\phi0) cos(\phi1)
   + sin(\alpha) sin(\theta) sin(\psi)

If you don't like Cartesian coordinates, you can express the sun's apparent
position with two angles. Its angle of elevation off the (south) horizon is
arctan(U/sqrt(N^2+E^2)); the angle it makes with the line to the east is
arctan(N/E).

Remember, \alpha is a global constant; \theta is fixed by the observer's
latitude; \psi changes across a year; \phi1 is essentially the time since noon,
and sec(\phi0) is sqrt( 1 + [ tan(\psi).cos(\alpha) ] ^ 2 ).  

Actually the above formula is ambiguous: there are two square roots.
We choose the one with the same sign as  cos(\theta) cos(\psi),
so that when  \phi1=0  (i.e., when it is NOON) we get the larger possible
value of  U -- the sun is higher in the sky at NOON than at midnight.

================ 4. Descriptive motions ================================

Having never been outside the north temperate zone, I can only comment
on the extent to which the above formulas agree with my experience. But
even in extreme cases it is easy to compute what the behaviour of the
sun will appear to be as it appears to trace out motion in a unit sphere
above the observer's head.

From the formulas in section 3  we see that 
	cos(\theta) N + sin(\theta)U = sin(\alpha) sin(\psi). 

This says the sun appears to travel in a certain plane in
space, a plane that appears to cross the flat earth in an east-west line,
making an angle equal to our latitude (=\theta) with the flat earth, and
crossing the horizon (i.e. the plane  U=0  of the flat earth) at a point with
N  coordinate  sin(\alpha) sin(\psi) sec(\theta). (Strictly speaking, the
plane moves north or south a bit during the day, since  \psi  changes.)
You may have seen this plane if you have seen time-lapse pictures of the
sun's transit in a day. The formulas predict what may not be
immediately obvious: that the inclination of this plane never changes
(at one point on earth), and that it is highest at its southernmost point.

Observe that the sun can rise north of east even in the northern
hemishpere (point of sunrise varies with sin(\psi) across the year to
a maximum  N  coordinate of  sin(\alpha) sec(\theta).) 

The motion of the sun in this plane is also easily given. We have that
its position in  (N,E,U) coordinates is of the form  
v1 + v2 cos(\phi1) + v3 sin(\phi1) for three vectors  v1 v2 v3. Again
discounting the change of  \psi  across a day, this motion is a circle,
centered at the point sin(\alpha) sin(\psi) ( cos(\theta), 0, sin(\theta) ).
This center point is always on a fixed line pointing due north and up,
making an angle with the horizontal equal to the observer's latitude. As
the year progresses, the center point moves along the line, either above
or below the earth's surface according to season. At the equinoxes, the
sun's circular path is centered on the earth's surface, and the sun
rises due east, precisely at 6am local time. At the solistices, the
center is a distance  sin(\alpha) away from the observer. (This is the
same displacement for all observers, although of course the direction of
the displacement is different for observers at different latitudes.)

At the equator (\theta=0) the plane is vertical, and the sun sweeps out
a circular path in this vertical circle. Only at the equinoxes is the
sun ever directly overhead  (i.e. at coordinates  (0,0,1) ).

As the observer moves away from the origin, the plane of the sun's motion
begins to tilt, and the magnitude of the seasonal variations becomes
greater: the location of the sun at solistice dawn moves progressively
farther from east, and the length of the day increases.

At the arctic (or anarctic) circle (+-\theta = 90 - \alpha), the sun
follows the semicircular arc at the equinox, but by summer solistice,
the sun rises due north (or south) just after midnight, travel all the way
around the compass, and set (briefly) the next midnight (hence the 'land
of the midnight sun'). The circle describing the sun's motion is
tangent to the plane of the earth. By winter solistice, the circle of the
sun's motion has dropped to a parallel circle again tangent to the
plane of the earth, but now under the observer. The sun that day will not
rise until noon, it will do so due south (or north), and immediately set.

In the polar regions, the sun's plane of motion changes during the year
along an axis which is now even more vertical. At equinox, the sun still
rises east at 6am, although it will not rise high by noon. At some point
in the year, the sun's path is tangent to the earth's surface, and we have
behaviour similar to that describe at the arctic circle at solistice
(although the noon elevation is smaller). The condition which describes
the time of year (i.e. \psi) is that  
	cot(\psi) = sin(\alpha) sqrt( tan^2(\theta) - tan^2(90-\alpha)),
which makes it clear that this can only happen past \theta=90-\alpha.
Thereafter, the sun's path moves to a smaller parallel circle higher in 
the sky, so that although the sun moves from due south at noon to due
north at midnight, its midnight location is still above the horizon. Naturally,
in the sinter months the situation is reverse: the days grow shorter, with
sunrise progressivly more southerly, until the day the sun fails to rise
and prolonged darkness begins.

At the north pole, (\theta=90), the sun's motion is in a circle parallel to
the earth's surface. At equinox, the sun is indeed due east at the horizon
at 6 am, but the rest of that day it travels around the compass points without
leaving the horizon. As summer progresses, the sun's path is along a circle
progressively more elevated (and of smaller radius) until by solistice it
is of apparently elevation sin(\alpha) and radius cos(\alpha). Then it
grows larger and lower until autumn equinox and then 6 months darkness.

(I would appreciate corrections, corroborations, or questions, since these
are rather specific predictions based only on the mathematics.)

=============== 5. Dealing with clock time========================

Typically we want to find the sun knowing only the time on the clock,
rather than the time since what we have called  NOON.

Clock time can be converted to Greenwich Mean Time by adding a conversion
factor based (mostly) on longitude (and adjusting for summer time changes).
If the observer's longitude is \beta degrees West, then the observer
is _roughly_  (\beta)/15 time zones ahead of Greenwich, and so (local
political decisions excepted) the clock time in Greenwich, when the observer
records the time as  T, should be
	T + round( \beta / 15).

On the other hand, local NOON will occur precisely \beta/15 hours after
NOON occurs in Greenwich, that is, NOON is at 
	12:00 + \beta/15 GMT

Comparing these formulas we see that NOON occurs for an observer
when the observer's clock reads
	12:00 + {x-round(x)}    where  x=\beta/15

Thus, barring irregularities due to political considerations, NOON
should occur roughly at 12:00, the difference directly calculable from
longitude. Users ought to be able to add or subtract a whole number of
hours to get correct correspondences (India, Saudi Arabia, and
other areas excluded).

=============== 6. Calculating time and place of dawn and dusk=============

As was the case with NOON, it is helpful to treat \psi as a
constant in these cases too (i.e. to ignore the progress of the earth
around the sun within a single day). Thus, with a fixed observer (hence
\theta) and on a fixed day (hence \psi) we may write  U  in the form
(see section  3)

	U = A cos(\phi1) + C.

"Dawn" and "Dusk" are the moments when  U = 0; we solve to find  \phi1.
Clearly these are the values of  \phi1  making cos(\phi1) = -C/A, i.e.
	\phi1 = arccos(-C/A).
	      = arccos(-sin(\alpha) tan(\theta) tan(\psi) / sec(\phi0) )
where  sec(\phi0)  is the square root described in section 3:
	sqrt( 1 + [ tan(\psi).cos(\alpha) ] ^ 2 ),
chosen to have the same sign as  cos(\theta) cos(\psi).

The two smallest solutions to this (in absolute value) are the values of
\phi1  which describe the time before or after  NOON  to get dawn and
dusk respectively. Thus the length of the (sunlit) day is the difference
between these two, i.e., 2 arccos( -C/A ). We will write  \phiD for the
value of  \phi1  corresponding to  dusk, so that a day is  2\phiD
(in hours, 2(\phiD * 24/(2\pi)) .)

We also recall that the position of the sun at dusk is  (N,0,E)  where
E = -sqrt(1-N^2)  (we use the negative square root since the sun sets in the 
West.) The value of  N  was obtained at the end of section 3:
N = sin(\alpha) sin(\psi) sec(\theta). It is traditional to report a
position such as that of the setting sun by giving its bearing north (or south)
of east (or west). The angle in question is  arctan(N/|E|) north of west,
or simply arcsin(N). This is not directly east/west, but clearly
depends on the tilt of the earth (\alpha), the oberver's latitude (\theta),
and the time of year (\psi).

================= 7. Solar Power===========================

The sunlight which falls can be measured as an amount of energy. This
energy is useful in heating a house in winter, and an obstruction to
cooling in the summer. The amount of sunlight translates rather directly
to energy gain by plants in a garden, although gardeners will have to
discover for themselves how effectively plants can use this energy for
growth and flowering. Those interested in solar energy collection may
wish to adjust the positions of their solar collectors based on the following 
information.

The solar radiation reaching earth's orbit is quite constant over time;
it varies most because the earth is at some times a bit further from the
sun. The variations we contend with however are a function of energy loss
between the light's arrival at earth orbit and our reception of it at
the earth's surface.

Radiation of photons from a hot source is the classic black-body problem
of quantum mechanics. The total energy radiated is proportional to the
mass of the object and to the fourth power of its temperature. However,
those radiating photons have many different wavelengths; the distribution
of how many photons are emitted of each wavelength is a well-known but
complex function of temperature and wavelength which I will not reproduce.
The intensity of the radiation diminishes by a factor proportional to
the square of the distance from the sun. At the earth's orbit, the total
energy from the sun, across all wavelengths, is 1.40 kw/m^2 (that is,
1.40 kwh per square meter of collector per hour of exposure).

What happens to this energy? For the most part, the photons travel
through the air and onto the surface of the earth, where they are
either reflected or absorbed (the latter causing a gain in energy of a
molecule, that is, the substance gets warmer). Not all wavelengths are
absorbed or reflected equally (hence "opacity" and "color" of some objects).
Among the substances which absorb the solar radiation are clouds and
obstacles (trees, buildings) -- local variations for which I cannot account 
in this discussion. 

The one remaining variable is the angle of inclination of the surface
to the line of the solar rays. If the surface is perpendicular to the
incoming rays, the light collection is maximal; if tilted, one only
gets as much energy as was in the photons of light whose path is 
intercepted. Thus we can measure the _percentage_ of the maximal
amount of energy which a tilted surface will receive. This is just the
area of the projection (shadow) of the collector onto the plane perpendicular
to the solar rays, divided by the total are of the collector. 

Mathematically, this is the dot product of: the unit vector in the
direction of the sun, and the unit vector perpendicular to the collector.
The former is the vector (N,E,U) described at the end of section 3. 
For the latter, I will mention several special cases:
	(1) A solar collector trained to point always to the sun has
unit normal vector also equal to  (N,E,U). In this case, the dot product
is  1,  i.e., this solar collector is collecting energy at 100% of the
maximal rate. 
	(2) Flat, level ground has a unit normal  (0,0,1). Thus, the
energy collected in such a garden is  (0,0,1)*(N,E,U) = U  percent of
maximal. (U  is given at the end of section 3.)
	(3) A vertical wall facing south has unit normal (-1,0,0);
other vertical walls have normals (a,b,0), where the relative values of
a  and  b  measure the orientation of the direction faced, north and east.
The amount of sunlight falling on this surface is (aN+bE) of maximal.

In all cases, if the dot product is negative, this indicates the sun is
behind the collector. Possibly a solar collector can be 2-sided to take
account of this, but a garden or a house wall will collect no energy when
the sun is below the horizon or when the wall is in shadow, respectively.
(Ignoring, of course, the collection of reflected light, moonlight, and so on.)

Given the amount of solar flux at all times  t  in a day, one can 
integrate across all times to get the total solar energy collected daily.
For example, a solar collector which may move to follow the sun collects
an amount proportional to the length of the sunlit day (see section 6).
For a fixed-direction, one-sided collector with normal vector (a,b,c), the 
integral must be done over the time during which the sun is on the appropriate
side of the collector. 

Recalling our previous formulas:

N= -             sin(\theta) cos(\psi) sec(\phi0) cos(\phi1)
   + sin(\alpha) cos(\theta) sin(\psi)

E= -                         cos(\psi) sec(\phi0) sin(\phi1)

U= +             cos(\theta) cos(\psi) sec(\phi0) cos(\phi1)
   + sin(\alpha) sin(\theta) sin(\psi)

we will write these as

N = A cos(\phi1) + B    E = C sin(\phi1)   U = D cos(\phi1) + F

Then the condition that the sun be in front of a collector with normal
(a,b,c) is that  [Aa+Dc] cos(\phi1) + [Cb] sin(\phi1) + [Ba+Fc] >= 0.
The easiest way to solve such an inequality
	K cos(\phi1) + M sin(\phi1) + P >= 0
is to divide by   sqrt(M^2+N^2)  and then find an angle \gamma with
	sin(\gamma) = K/sqrt(M^2+K^2)
	cos(\gamma) = M/sqrt(M^2+K^2)
(which implies \gamma  is an arctangent of  K/M) and then use a trig
identity to rewrite the condition as sin(\phi1 + \gamma) + P/sqrt(M^2+K^2) >=0.
For  P  sufficiently large, the solution set is empty; if sufficiently
negative, the solution set is the set of all  \phi1. But in general,
this will hold for all values of  \phi1  in an interval, say the
interval  (\phi2, \phi3). Since in applications we get no sunlight when
the sun is below the horizon (even if we point our collector in the "right"
direction!) we will intersect this interval with  (-\phiD, \phiD) so
as to assume the light really is in front of the collector for times
from  \phi1= \phi2  to  \phi3.

The integral of the solar flux is then
[Aa+Dc][sin(\phi3)-sin(\phi2)] - [Cb][cos(\phi3)-cos(\phi2)] 
	+ [Ba+Fc][\phi3-\phi2]

An important special case is an upward facing collector, that is, the
flat ground. In this case, \phi2 and \phi3  are the moments of dawn
and dusk respectively, and we get simply
	2D sin(\phiD) + 2F \phiD, 
that is,
         2 cos(\theta) cos(\psi) sec(\phi0) sin(\phiD)
	+2 sin(\alpha) sin(\theta) sin(\psi) \phiD

I will not address the issue of total energy gain across a year, which if
nothing else can be found by adding 365 daily values.

================= 8. Estimation of Errors===========================

Throughout this analysis we have made assumptions which will introduce
errors into our predictions.

Probably the worst error here is ignoring the 1/4 of 1% change in the
earth's position (\psi) within the course of a day.

While the earth's orbit is very nearly circular, the ellipticity most
noticeably means that the earth's orbit is not centered at the sun
(small change in ratio of semi-axes can imply a rather larger change
in separation of foci). While distance to the sun is more or less
irrelevant here, Kepler's laws imply the earth's revolution around the
sun is rather slower when the earth is at its furthest point. (I
believe d\psi/dt is about 6% slower in June.) Presumably ignoring this 
effect is of less consequence than ignoring d\psi/dt altogether.

Replacing the observer-sun vector with the earthcenter-sun vector changes
the apparent position of the sun by about 1 minute of arc. (The mean
earth-sun distance is about 23491 earth radii. This is about 3.4% greater
on July 4 than January 4, however.)

I am not sure what effect the non-sphericity of the earth has on the
sun position, but the difference in observer-earthcenter distances is
about 1/3 of 1%.

I am always happy to hear of modifications I should make to this file.
